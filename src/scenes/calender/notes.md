import FullCalendar from '@fullcalendar/react';
import dayGridPlugin from '@fullcalendar/daygrid'; // Importing the day grid plugin
import interactionPlugin from '@fullcalendar/interaction'; // Importing interaction plugin

const MyCalendar = () => {
  const handleDateClick = (info) => {
    alert('Date clicked: ' + info.dateStr);
  };

  return (
    <FullCalendar
      plugins={[dayGridPlugin, interactionPlugin]}
      initialView="dayGridMonth"
      dateClick={handleDateClick}
    />
  );
};

export default MyCalendar;
```

### Explanation of Example

- **`FullCalendar`**: The main component used to render the calendar.
- **`plugins`**: Array of plugins used to extend FullCalendar’s functionality.
- **`initialView`**: The default view of the calendar (e.g., month view).
- **`dateClick`**: Callback function triggered when a date is clicked.

By integrating FullCalendar into your project, you can create a dynamic and interactive calendar with various functionalities tailored to your needs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's break down the `handleDateClick` function step by step to understand how it works with the FullCalendar library:

### 1. **Function Definition**

```jsx
const handleDateClick = (selected) => {
```

- `handleDateClick` is a function that gets triggered when a user clicks on a date in the calendar.
- The `selected` parameter is an object provided by FullCalendar that contains information about the clicked date.

### 2. **Prompt User for Event Title**

```jsx
const title = prompt("Please enter a new title for your event");
```

- `prompt` is a built-in JavaScript function that shows a dialog box asking the user for input.
- The user is asked to enter a title for the new event.

### 3. **Access the Calendar API**

```jsx
const calendarApi = selected.view.calendar;
```

- `selected.view` provides access to the current calendar view.
- `calendarApi` is the FullCalendar API object that allows you to interact with the calendar, such as adding or removing events.

### 4. **Deselect the Date**

```jsx
calendarApi.unselect();
```

- `unselect` clears any previously selected date or time range. This is useful to reset the selection after adding the event.

### 5. **Add the Event**

```jsx
if (title) {
  calendarApi.addEvent({
    id: `${selected.dateStr}-${title}`,
    title,
    start: selected.startStr,
    end: selected.endStr,
    allDay: selected.allDay,
  });
}
```

- **`if (title)`**: Checks if the user has entered a title. If not, the event is not added.
- **`calendarApi.addEvent`**: Adds a new event to the calendar.
  - **`id`**: A unique identifier for the event, created by combining the date and title.
  - **`title`**: The title of the event (from user input).
  - **`start`**: The start date/time of the event (from `selected.startStr`).
  - **`end`**: The end date/time of the event (from `selected.endStr`).
  - **`allDay`**: Boolean indicating whether the event lasts all day (from `selected.allDay`).

### Summary

- When a user clicks on a date in the calendar, the `handleDateClick` function prompts them for an event title.
- It then uses the FullCalendar API to add an event to the calendar on the selected date with the given title.
- The `calendarApi.unselect()` call ensures that any previous date selection is cleared.

This functionality allows users to dynamically add events to the calendar by clicking on a date and providing a title.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the context of the `handleDateClick` function provided, `selected` is an argument passed to the function that contains information about the date or time that was clicked on the calendar. Here's a breakdown of what `selected` is and where it comes from:

### What is `selected`?

`selected` is an object provided by FullCalendar's event handling system. When a user interacts with the calendar, such as by clicking on a date, FullCalendar triggers a callback function with an object that contains details about the interaction. 

In the `handleDateClick` function, `selected` includes the following properties:

- **`dateStr`**: A string representation of the clicked date in ISO format (e.g., `2023-08-23`).
- **`startStr`**: The start date/time of the selected date range or event, as a string in ISO format.
- **`endStr`**: The end date/time of the selected date range or event, as a string in ISO format.
- **`allDay`**: A boolean indicating whether the event spans the entire day or just a specific time period.
- **`view`**: An object representing the current view of the calendar, which includes the `calendar` API.

### Where does `selected` come from?

`selected` is passed as an argument to the `handleDateClick` function from FullCalendar’s event system. 

Here’s how it gets to the `handleDateClick` function:

1. **Event Handling Configuration**: FullCalendar allows you to specify callback functions for various user interactions through its configuration options. For example, `dateClick` is one of these options and it specifies a function to call when a date is clicked.

2. **Triggering the Callback**: When a user clicks on a date, FullCalendar automatically calls the `handleDateClick` function and provides it with the `selected` object.

### Example in Context

Here’s how `selected` is used in the `handleDateClick` function:

```jsx
const handleDateClick = (selected) => {
  const title = prompt("Please enter a new title for your event");
  const calendarApi = selected.view.calendar;
  calendarApi.unselect();

  if (title) {
    calendarApi.addEvent({
      id: `${selected.dateStr}-${title}`,
      title,
      start: selected.startStr,
      end: selected.endStr,
      allDay: selected.allDay,
    });
  }
};
```

- **`selected.view.calendar`**: Accesses the FullCalendar API from the `view` property within `selected`.
- **`selected.dateStr`, `selected.startStr`, `selected.endStr`, `selected.allDay`**: Uses these properties to get details about the clicked date and to add a new event to the calendar.

### Summary

- **`selected`**: An object provided by FullCalendar containing details about the user’s interaction with the calendar.
- **Source**: Automatically passed by FullCalendar when the user clicks on a date or interacts with the calendar in a way that triggers the `handleDateClick` function.

By using the `selected` object, you can access various pieces of information about the clicked date and perform actions like adding or modifying events in the calendar.
